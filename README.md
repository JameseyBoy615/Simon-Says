## About

Simon is a memory based game where you must watch and listen as buttons light up and makes sounds. Then you must press the buttons in the same order as displayed to progress to the next round where the pattern becomes longer each round. THE Simon game was created in 1978, invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, inspired by the Atari game Touch Me. The inspiration behind choosing this game comes from Call of Duty: Black OPs 1 Zombies, where inside of this game ther was a secret puzzle or Easter Egg you can complete while playing. One of the steps to the Easter Egg were to complete several rounds or Simon. Friends and I always laughed at eachother when one of us would get the pattern wrong. So i chose this game as a tribute to those times back then.
